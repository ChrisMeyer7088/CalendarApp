#Project Environment
Using the npm package "dotenv" environmental variables are listed in the .env file and loaded through config.js
**IN ORDER TO RUN PROGRAM** users must create a .env file in the project root directory specifying the environmental variables configured in config.js. The .env file contains sensitive information and is not stored in the repository.
For more information on how to initalize environmental variables both manually and with "dotenv" see the following [resource] (https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/making-your-node-js-work-everywhere-with-environment-variables-2da8cdf6e786)
